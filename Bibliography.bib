            Do you sincerely want to be cited? Prestige depends on the number of times your academic paper gets cited.

	abstract = {Candidiasis, caused by yeasts of the genus Candida, is the second cause of superficial and mucosal infections and the fourth cause of bloodstream infections. Although some antifungal drugs to treat candidiasis are available, resistant strains to current therapies are emerging. Therefore, the search for new candicidal compounds is certainly a priority. In this regard, a series of indazole and pyrazole derivatives were designed in this work, employing bioisosteric replacement, homologation, and molecular simplification as new anticandidal agents. Compounds were synthesized and evaluated against C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis strains. The series of 3-phenyl-1H-indazole moiety (10a–i) demonstrated to have the best broad anticandidal activity. Particularly, compound 10g, with N,N-diethylcarboxamide substituent, was the most active against C. albicans and both miconazole susceptible and resistant C. glabrata species. Therefore, the 3-phenyl-1H-indazole scaffold represents an opportunity for the development of new anticandidal agents with a new chemotype.},

It was found that on interaction with hydrazine and phenylhydrazine both intermediate hydrazones and the final cyclization products, pyrazolines, were formed.

Several recent reports highlight dramatic reductions in reaction time and even superior selectivity when microwaves are used. However, there are still many controversies and unexplained effects in this area that deserve attention. We critically review the available sources attempting to establish trends and elucidate the actual status of this area of research. Additionally, where possible, we discuss the potential for scale-up and commercial utilization of microwaves and impediments that currently hold back their implementation. This critical review aims at highlighting the opportunity of combining catalysis with microwave technology for biomass conversion but also to stimulate the reader to generate future understanding of the influence of the microwaves in catalytic processes in general.},

	abstract = {Improved laboratory protocols for convenient and rapid transformations are highly desired in modern synthetic chemistry. Microwave irradiated reactions have received considerable attention in recent years and it is a subject of intense discussion in the scientific community. Microwave heating is more efficient in terms of the energy used, produces higher temperature homogeneity and is considerably more rapid than conventional heating methods. This technique as an alternative to conventional energy sources for introduction of energy into reactions has become a recognized practical method in various fields of chemistry. Microwave-assisted organic synthesis ({MAOS}) is known for the spectacular accelerations produced in many reactions as a consequence of the increased heating rate, a phenomenon that cannot be easily reproduced by classical heating means. As a result, higher yields, milder reaction conditions and shorter reaction times can often be attained. Its specific heating method attracts extensive interest not only because of rapid volumetric heating, but also for suppressed side reactions, energy saving, decreased environmental pollutions and safe operations. In this review, we will try to represent an overview on origin and fundamental features of microwave ovens and its usefulness in {MAOS}.},

In this work we develop new ligands containing a β-diketone chelating functionality, to better control the stereochemistry at the metal center, and tetrazolyl multidentate bridging groups, a combination not yet explored for networking with metal ions. The new ligands, 1,3-bis(4-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl)-1,3-propanedione (H3L1) and 1-phenyl-3-(4-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl)-1,3-propanedione (H2L2), are synthesized from the corresponding nitrile precursors by [2+3] dipolar cycloaddition of azide under metal-free catalytic conditions. Crystal structure analysis evidences the involvement of tetrazolyl fragments in multiple hydrogen bonding giving 2D and 1D supramolecular frameworks. Reactivity of the new ligands with different metal salts indicates good coordinating ability, and we report the preparation and structural characterization of the tris–chelate complex [Fe({HL}1)3]3− (1) and the homometallic 2D {CP} [{ZnL}2({DMSO})] (2). In compound 1 only the diketonate donor is used, whereas the partially deprotonated tetrazolyl groups are involved in hydrogen bonding, giving rise to a 2D supramolecular framework of (6,3){IIa} topological type. In compound 2 the ligand is completely deprotonated and uses both the diketonate donor (chelating) and the tetrazolate fragment (bridging) to coordinate the Zn({II}) ions. The resulting neutral 2D network of sql topology shows luminescence in the solid state, which is red shifted with respect to the free ligand. Interestingly, it can be easily exfoliated in water to give a luminescent colloidal solution.},
