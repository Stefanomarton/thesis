After the initial infusion, the babies received no colloid or alkali solutions until 4 hours of age. We managed them supportively with warmth, appropriate oxygen administration, isotonic fluid infusion, and close monitoring. Among the infants who received alkali, 14 of 26 acquired the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), 11 died, and four had intracranial hemorrhage. Among babies who received no alkali, RDS occurred in 11 of 27, 5 died, and none had intracranial hemorrhage. These results do not support the common practice of rapidly infusing NaHCO3 into high-risk, premature infants, and they suggest that the early management of such infants needs renewed critical evaluation.},

Although some antifungal drugs to treat candidiasis are available, resistant strains to current therapies are emerging. Therefore, the search for new candicidal compounds is certainly a priority. In this regard, a series of indazole and pyrazole derivatives were designed in this work, employing bioisosteric replacement, homologation, and molecular simplification as new anticandidal agents. Compounds were synthesized and evaluated against C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis strains. The series of 3-phenyl-1H-indazole moiety (10a–i) demonstrated to have the best broad anticandidal activity. Particularly, compound 10g, with N,N-diethylcarboxamide substituent, was the most active against C. albicans and both miconazole susceptible and resistant C. glabrata species. Therefore, the 3-phenyl-1H-indazole scaffold represents an opportunity for the development of new anticandidal agents with a new chemotype.},
