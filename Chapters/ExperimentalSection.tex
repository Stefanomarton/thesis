\section{General information}
The reagents and solvents used in this thesis are commercially available and were generally used without further purification.

The THF used for the synthesis of the DikDiEst and DikDiCN has been anhydrified on sodium/benzophenone and distilled before use.

The synthesis of the DikDiCN and DikDiEst was carried out according to the synthesis methods reported in previous work. In particular, the synthesis conditions relating to DiCN are reported in the article \cite{carlucci_heterometallic_2010} and in Marco Visconti's thesis. The conditions relating to the synthesis of DikDiEst and DikDiAc are instead reported in the thesis "" by Simone Galeazzi.

\todo[inline]{Mi manca il titolo della tesi di Marco Visconti, inoltre il titolo della tesi di Simone in italiano on in inglese? Per quanto riguarda fornitore reagenti dovrebbe essere Merck?}

The reactions were carried out under aerobic conditions, except for the synthesis reaction of the
DikDiCN ligand and DikDiEst, were carried out under anhydrous conditions in a nitrogen atmosphere, as specified in the respective synthesis conditions.

The reaction is carried out under N$_{2}$ atmosphere, the reactants are carefully dried beforehand.\\
In a flask, 1.132 g of NaH dispersion in mineral oil are washed with anhydrous THF (15 mL x 2).\\
4.0 g of methyl 4-acetyl benzoate and 4.4 g of dimethyl terephthalate are dissolved in 45 mL of anhydrous THF, and then NaH suspension in THF is added with pasteur pipette.\\
The mixture is heated to reflux overnight. \\
Evaporation of the solvent under vacuum gives a dark brown compound. The solid is taken up in water and acidified with HCl 20\% in an ice bath. Taking care to leave it to react for a few hours and checking the pH to make sure it is acid. More water is added if mixing is particularly difficult.\\
The raw product is recovered as a yellow solid by filtration with a Buchner funnel.
To eliminate the impurities of the remaining reagents the solid is washed with chloroform and with diethyl ether. The solid is lastly collected on a Buchner funnel and dried. Yield: 92\%, 8.67 g of product.

The ligand DikDiCN (0.617 g) is suspended in EtOH (70 mL) a solution of 35\% aq. \(Et_{4}NOH\) (1.120 g) is added. After addition of 5 mL of an ethanolic solution of \(ZnCl_2\) (0.103 g) the mixture is left under stirring overnight. The product is recovered as a yellow solid by filtration, washed with water and dried in the air.

The ligand DikDiCN (0.200 g) is suspended in EtOH (134 mL) and a solution of 35\% aq. \(Et_{4}NOH\) (0.356 mL) is added. After addition of 16 mL of an ethanolic solution of \(CoCl_2 \cdot 6H_2O\) (0.103 g) the mixture is left under stirring for 1 h. The product is recovered as a dark orange solid by filtration, washed with water and dried in the air.

\end{center}

The Fe III metalloligand (0.050 g) is dissolved in 20 mL of \(CH_{2}Cl_{2}\) (Sol. A) and \(AgClO_{4}\) (0.035 g) in 20 ml of acetone (Sol. B). Solution B were slowly added to solution A in a crystallizing dish (50 mL). Yellow microcrystalline powders formed in about 7 days on slowly concentrate the two solutions left in the air. The solid was collected on a Buckner funnel, washed with dichloromethane and dried in the air.
