\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Supramolecular Chemistry, why?}\label{sec:supramolecular-chemistry}
Supramolecular chemistry can be classified as the branch of chemistry concerned about the interplay between designed molecular assemblies and intermolecular bonds, or more colloquially referred to as ``chemistry beyond the molecule''\cite{desiraju_chemistry_2001}. \\
The discipline focuses on the design and synthesis of molecular architectures by relying on the complementary recognition, and subsequent assembly, of well-defined subunits. The products of complementary synthesis, the so-called ``supermolecules'' are sustained by non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding, coordination forces and \(\pi-\pi\) interactions. \\
The emergence of supramolecular chemistry has directly influenced how efficiently chemists can design and synthesize desired frameworks. The development and application of the bottom up approach is widely successful, owing to the non-covalent forces that dictate structural and morphological properties, while producing structures that were previously inaccessible.

\subsection{Host-Guest Chemistry}\label{subsec:host-guest-chemistry}
In supramolecular chemistry, host–guest chemistry describes complexes that are composed of two or more molecules or ions that are held together in unique structural relationships by forces other than those of full covalent bonds. Host–guest chemistry encompasses the idea of molecular recognition and interactions through non-covalent bonding. Non-covalent bonding is critical in maintaining the 3D structure of large molecules.\\
Host-guest interaction has raised dramatic attention since it was discovered. It is an important field because many biological processes require the host-guest interaction, and it can be useful in material designs.

\section{Metal-Organic Frameworks}\label{subsec:mof}
Metal-Organic Frameworks represent since 1995 \cite{yaghi_hydrothermal_1995} an exciting and rapidly growing area of research within the field of supramolecular chemistry.\\
MOFs' chemistry is a specific type of supramolecular chemistry that involve the coordination of metal ions with organic ligands to form highly porous and crystalline materials with a unique structure. \\
MOFs are obtained from the reaction between an organic linker and inorganic species, such as clusters or metal ions. The metal ions act as nodes that are connected by the organic ligands to create a three-dimensional framework. By understanding and tweaking the features of these two components within the material, it is possible to predict and tune the chemical and physical properties of the framework.\\
This offers a wide range of tunable properties that depend on both from the inorganic joints and the organic linkers. By looking closer at the organic linker, it is possible to imagine a tuning of the shape (e.g.\ ligand coordination angles), size (e.g.\ dimension of the ligand as expansion or shrinkage) but also, functionality (e.g.\ decoration of the pores depending on the substituent of the organic unit) of the MOF.\\
The self-assembly of these components, typically done in solution, generate a linkage extended in a 3D crystalline framework that is characterized by large pores filled of solvent. Interesting, this rigid structure can stand vacuum: after removal of the solvent molecules the structure usually remains intact. \\
The resulting structure has a large internal surface area and can adsorb gases and other molecules with high efficiency, making MOFs useful in a variety of applications, such as gas storage, catalysis, drug delivery and molecule harvesting.

\subsection{Carboxylate–Based Metal–Organic Frameworks}\label{cb-mof}

Carboxylate ligands are tipically obtained from the acid-base reaction of a carboxilic acid with an appropriate base, their electronic structure determines the properties that follows. \\
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=10cm,height=3cm,keepaspectratio]{Structures/carboxstructure.eps}
	\caption{Carboxilate structure}\label{fig:carboxstructure}
\end{figure}

The carboxylate oxygen atoms can coordinate with metal ions through their lone pairs of electrons, forming metal-carboxylate coordination bonds. The metal-carboxylate bonds formed by carboxylate ligands are generally strong due to the high electronegativity of oxygen and the polarizability of the carboxylate group. The binding strength can be influenced by the nature of the metal ion, the electronic properties of the ligand, and the coordination geometry. Strong metal-carboxylate bonds contribute to the stability of the MOF framework. \\
The carboxylate group can serve in multiple coordination mode although the one that is typically adopted: the ligand coordinates to the metal ion through both oxygen atoms.\\

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=16cm,height=3cm,keepaspectratio]{Structures/carboxcordmode.eps}
	\caption{Examples of carboxilate coordination modes}\label{fig:carboxcordmode}
\end{figure}

Their geometric arrangement and flexibility can vary. The length and conformation of the carbon backbone connecting the carboxylate groups can affect the spatial arrangement of the ligand and rigidity or flexibility of the ligand can impact the packing arrangement and the resulting MOF structure. \\
Carboxylate ligands can also incorporate various functional groups, such as aromatic rings, electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups, and functional moieties (e.g., -OH, -NH$_{2}$). These functional groups can impart additional reactivity and chemical properties to the MOF, enabling specific applications. The presence of functional groups can also affect the hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature of the MOF.\\
The solubility of carboxylate ligands plays a crucial role in MOF synthesis. Some ligands are readily soluble in common solvents, facilitating the preparation of precursor solutions and the synthesis of MOFs. However, certain carboxylate ligands may exhibit limited solubility, necessitating the use of specialized solvent systems or modifications in reaction conditions to ensure proper ligand incorporation and MOF formation.

The divalent metal carboxylate based frameworks MOF-5 and HKUST-1 are examples of prototypical MOF materials and triggered a huge growth in the field of metal-organic frameworks.

MOF-5, is a cubic metal–organic framework with the chemical formula \(Zn_{4}O(BDC)_{3}\), where BDC$^{-2}$ represents 1,4-benzodicarboxylate. It was first discovered by Omar M. Yaghi and is recognised for its remarkable characteristic of possessing one of the highest surface area to volume ratios amongst all known metal–organic frameworks, measuring at 2200 m2/cm3.Additionally, it has garnered significance as the pioneering MOF in the area of hydrogen gas storage research.

Within this structure, oxygen atoms are denoted in red, carbon atoms in black, and hydrogen atoms in white. Additionally, tetrahedrons are used to illustrate the coordination of BDC (1,4-benzodicarboxylate) molecules with the central Zinc atom.}
\end{figure}

The HKUST-1 framework utilizes dimeric metal units linked by benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate linkers. The paddlewheel unit is frequently employed to describe the arrangement of metal centres and is also known as the secondary building unit (SBU) within the HKUST-1 structure. The paddlewheel unit consists of two metal centres connected by four benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate linkers.\\
In the hydrated state, each of the two metal centres in the axial position of the paddlewheel unit is coordinated to a single water molecule. This state is commonly observed when the material is exposed to air. However, a process of activation, which involves heating and vacuum treatment, can remove these water molecules, resulting in a dehydrated state. In the absence of water, the coordination sites on the metal atoms are vacant and are identified as coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS). These CUS can be reached by other molecules.

\subsection{1,3–Diketones–Based Metal–Organic Frameworks}\label{dk-mof}
Classical \(\beta\)-diketones and related ligands have been studied for more than a century and their ability to give rise to a rich and interesting coordination and supramolecular chemistry is well documented\cite{aromi_poly_2008}. The widespread use of \(\beta\)-diketones structure as chelating ligand in coordination chemistry and the stability of its complexes with a number of metal ions originate from its chemical properties, determined by the keto–enol tautomerism.

	\caption{\(\beta\)-diketones keto-entol tautomerism}\label{fig:diktau}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{1,3-diketones as ligands}
They act under appropriate conditions as uninegative chelating donors, capable of stabilizing mononuclear or polynuclear complexes. One of the reason of such stabilization capability is the aromatic character of the chelate ring.

\subsection{Azoles-Based Metal-Organic Framerworks}\label{az-mof}
Heterocycles are a remarkable class of compounds in terms of the biological, chemical and technological roles they play. Azoles, in particular, owe their importance to the fact that they occur in natural and synthetic molecules, but also to their fascinating coordinating chemistry, which has allowed their use in a wide range of applications. \\
Although azoles are mostly known as bases (i.e. pyridines), the five-membered azoles, including imidazole, pyrazole, triazole, and tetrazole can also be deprotonated to form the corresponding azolate anion. The possibility of generating this azolate anions not only it allows all N atoms to coordinate with metal ions in many different coordination modes, but also further increases the basicity of these donor sites. Consequently, azolate ligands can generate coordination compounds with a particularly high thermal and chemical stability which is one of the most important issues for practical applications of coordination polymers.
For these reasones azolates have been widely used as bridging ligands for coordination polymers before the beginning of the past decade.
\subsubsection{Pyrazole Ring}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=6cm,height=3cm,keepaspectratio]{Structures/pyrazole.eps}
	\caption{Pyrazole structure}\label{fig:pyrstc}
\end{figure}

Simple 1H-pyrazoles have a Lewis acid N-H group at N$_1$ and a Lewis basic pyridine N-donor N$_2$ directly adjacent to each other. Thus, electronically, these heterocycles are both $\sigma$-donor and $\pi$-acceptor/donor ligands. In addition, they are planar and non-bulky ligands. For these reasons, the pyrazole ring is one of the easiest and most flexible N-donor heterocycles to incorporate into larger polydentate ligand structures. \\
Pyrazole and only a handful of its derivatives are commercially available, but by using a variety of synthetic approaches it is possible to create substituted pyrazole rings with a wide range of substituents on their carbon atoms.
\subsubsection{Pyrazolate as ligands}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=10cm,height=6cm,keepaspectratio]{Structures/pyrazolecordmode.eps}
	\caption{Pyrazole coordination modes}\label{fig:pyrazole-cord-mode}
\end{figure}
Pyrazolate have been found to bind metals in a variety of coordination modes and can also act as bridging ligands.
After deprotonation of the N-H pyrazole, the obtained pyrazolate anion can be classified to act mainly in three different coordination modes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item  mono-dentate mode
	\item exo-bidentate \((\eta^{1}-\eta^{1})\)
	\item endo-bidentate \((\eta^{2})\)
\end{itemize}
This coordination ability is controlled by the nature of the metal ion and the substituents on the pyrazole ring, infact the substituents at the 3 and 5 positions (shown in \ref{fig:pyrstc}) can modify the steric properties, whereas substituents at the 4-position can mainly change the electronic properties

\subsubsection{Pyrazolates MOFs examples}

MOF-303 and its derivatives demonstrate the superiority of pyrazole-based MOFs. They have significant real-world applications, especially as highly water-permeable\cite{cong_highly_2021} and water harvesting\cite{zheng_broadly_2022} materials.

The MOF is based on a bicarboxylate pyrazole ligand, but in this case the pyrazole does not perform a coordinating function, but rather decorates the structural motif. The pyrazole function serves as an active site for establishing hydrogen bonds, enabling interactions with molecules that can subsequently be captured in the active sites. These crystals are classified in the monoclinic space group and their rod-shaped SBU comprises cis-trans-alternating corner-shared AlO$_{6}$ octahedra (figure \ref{fig:mof303structure}).

\begin{figure}[h!]

	\includegraphics[width=6cm,keepaspectratio]{Images/MOF303.jpeg}
	\caption{MOF-303 structure}\label{fig:mof303structure}
\end{figure}

\section{Rationale and Objectives}\label{sec:rat-obj}

The purpose of this thesis is to design a novel ligand structure comprising two carboxyl functionalities and a pyrazole ring. The primary objective is to synthesize new MOFs and to explore their gas storage potential and MOF uptake capacity. The research is based on the current collective knowledge in this field, with inspiration drawn from Professor Carlucci's earlier work, DikDiAc, which has previously been subject to extensive investigation.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=8cm,keepaspectratio]{Structures/dikdiac.eps}
	\caption{DikDiAc structure}
\end{figure}

Beginning with the work on DikDiAc, the assessment of the synthetic pattern to obtain PyrDiAc (the structure is shown in the figure below) started.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=8cm,keepaspectratio]{Structures/pyr-ac2.eps}
	\caption{PyrDiAc structure}
\end{figure}

The PyrDiAc is intended to maintain the free pyrazole function. The ligand structure takes inspiration from the ligand employed in synthesizing MOF-303 \cite{cong_highly_2021}\cite{zheng_broadly_2022}, which was conducted by Professor O. M. Yaghi and of which the structure is demonstrated below.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=4.5cm,keepaspectratio]{Structures/ligand303.eps}
	\caption{MOF-303 ligand structure}
\end{figure}

The aim is to assess the most efficient synthetic pattern and enhance it to enable the exploration of the ligand's reactivity with multiple metals for synthesising new MOFs. The synthesis should aim to be technically efficient and rapid and, above all, to provide sufficient yields to study and synthesise the reactivity of the ligand with metals.\\
If the desired outcomes are achieved, it is intended to proceed with investigating the reactivity of the ligand.
